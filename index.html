        <h1>Welcome to my website! Here you can find information about my professional experience, education history, and learn more about who I am as a person.</h1>
        <h2>
          <p>My name is Grace Squibbs and I am a senior at Michigan State University. I will be graduating in May with a degree in Media and Information and a minor in Information Technology.</p>
          <p>My goals after graduation include building my professional resume in any way that I can and continuing to build my hard and soft skills. I have an interest in project management and would like to become certified in the next few years while beginning my career. I hope to work in settings where I can use my critical thinking and communication skills to organize and execute projects. While I work in a professional project management setting I will continue to build my web design skills so that I can keep myself open to that industry.</p>
          <p>In my free time I enjoy being active and going on adventures. I like to be outside and enjoy going on hikes and seeing beautiful sites that mother nature has to offer. I also enjoy eating good food with my friends, whether that be trying new recipes at home or finding local hidden gems to try. All around, I am an outgoing person who has a yearning for adventure. I like to be pushed outside of my comfort zone and to be exposed to new things and new points of view.</p>
          <p>I hope you enjoy this website, and for all contact information you can go to the Resume tab to find a downloadble copy of my resume.</p>
